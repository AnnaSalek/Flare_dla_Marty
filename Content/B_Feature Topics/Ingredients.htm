        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <p>
There are a variety of recipes avaliable on the Internet, but they all more or less start with the same base: <b>powdered substance</b> (powdered sugar or meringue powder which consists of dried pasteurized egg whites), <b>liquid</b> (raw egg whites, pasteurized egg whites or water) and <b>additives enhancing taste and aroma</b>. The most common flavorings are: vanilla extract, almond extract and lemon juice.

In order to avoid Salmonella infection. Liquid egg whites are pasteurised, so there's no risk involved. As the icing dries, the conditions under which bacteria can grow are greatly diminished, especially if there was little to no bacteria in the eggs to begin with. They are easier to work with - packed in a convinient bottle, so there is no sloppy separating egg yolks from whites. What's more, you take only as much as you need - you can freeze the rest for later use.</span>

        <p>Liguid egg whites are avaliable on <a href="https://allegro.pl/" title="Link to Allegro platform" alt="Link to Allegro platform">Allegro</a>, in stores for confectioners like Torty Torty or stores with dietary supplements and nutrients for active people like KFD, SFD etc. Personally, I use and recommend liquid whites from <a href="https://farmabialka.pl/" title="The Polish manufacturer of liquid egg whites">Farma Białka</a>.
