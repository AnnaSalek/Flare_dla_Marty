        <h1>How to prepare Royal Icing?</h1>
        <p>
There are a variety of recipes avaliable on the Internet, but they all more or less start with the same base: powdered substance (powdered sugar or meringue powder), liquid (raw egg whites, pasteurized egg whites or water) and additives enhancing stability and/or taste and aroma. Dry ingredients are added to the wet and mixture is beaten on low speed until it thickens, and then flavorings are added - your RI&#160;is ready to be used. </p>
        <p>The most common flavorings are: vanilla extract, almond extract and lemon juice (the lemon juice not only improves the taste, but, due to it's acidity, stabilizes the icing.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h2>LIQUID EGG WHITES ROYAL ICING</h2>
        <p>Liquid egg whites </p>
        <p>Powdered sugar</p>
        <p> Fresh lemon juice </p>
        <p>1. Pour liquid egg whites into a bowl. On LOW speed beat in cream of tartar (if you use any). Then gradually add powdered sugar. Don’t add all of the powdered sugar at once. Continue beating after each addition of powdered sugar until icing is thick.</p>
        <p>2. Then beat in lemon juice from one lemon fruit. Mixing icing this way should take about 7 minutes or so. Store thick icing or use immediately.</p>

        <p>Avoid overmixing your icing (i.e. mixing on high or maximum speed). Your goal is get an icing, not the meringue! The overmixed, aerated icing looses it's stability and is prone to crusting and other, unpleasant outcomes.</p>
        <h2>STORING ROYAL ICING</h2>
        <p>It is very important that you protect icing from crusting. Thick icing crusts fairly quickly.</p>
        <p>It is essential that you cover it with a food packing plastic film and store it in an airtight container covered tightly, until ready to use.</p>
