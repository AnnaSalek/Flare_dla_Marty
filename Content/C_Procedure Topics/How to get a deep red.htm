        <h1>How to get a deep red colour?</h1>
        <p>
This section refers to red colour, but you might face similar issues while preparing any other deep colours like black, dark purple, deep forest green or dark orange. </p>
        <h2>Red is a very challenging icing colour. </h2>
        <p>Why is that? Because if you want to achieve a rich, vibrant shade (for your Santa cookies, for example) you need to add a lot of food coloring.</p>
        <p>

        <h3> And what happens if you add to much of it?
</h3>
        <ol>
            <li class="Lista">Your icing dries very slowly and is not totally hard.
Too much food coloring makes your icing oversaturated and slows down the hardening process. The texture of dried red royal icing with too much food coloring added is crumbly and a bit soft when touched. It wont dry completely hard even after whole night in a dehydrator.
</li>
            <li>It tastes terrible.
Adding too much food coloring makes the black royal icing taste bitter, and even lemon juice won't mask it. The bitterness is detectable in freshly prepared icing as well as after drying (if it dries at all). This side effect is less than desirable, especially if your cookies are going to be eaten by children.
</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>How to avoid said problems and achieve beautiful, deep tone?
</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Allow the color to develop at least 12 hours in refrigerator. The color of the icing naturally gets darker over time as the color is developing in the icing. Always dye your icing the night before for the best success.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
The bowl rule
</h2>
        <ul>
            <li class="Lista">If the icing is the exact color you want it in the bowl, you've added too much color! The color will continue to darken as you bag the icing, decorate and dry. So, you want the icing still to be a shade or two lighter in the bowl than you ultimately want.</li>
        </ul>
