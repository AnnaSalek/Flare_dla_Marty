        <h1>Your icing doesn’t dry completely.</h1>
        <h2> Why is that?</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>The first reason is that the oil has been introduced to the icing. Oil and royal icing do not mix! Most cookiers wipe their mixers down with white vinegar or lemon juice before mixing their icing to prevent this.
</li>
            <li>The other reason could be too hot and too humid environment. Royal icing needs a nice temperate environment to dry completely and needs to be exposed to the air to dry. This usually takes about overnight (approximately 8 hours if you dont use a food dehydrator).</li>
            <li>Icing dries crumbly. 
This could be for two reasons:
firstly the icing was overmixed (more than 10 minutes in the mixer).
The second is that too much food coloring was added to the icing. </li>
            <li>Icing dries with a matte/flat finish. Usually royal icing will dry with a sheen on its own, but it is definitely encouraged by the movement of air around this. You can achieve this by directly using a fan on the cookies while they dry or using a dehydrator.</li>
        </ol>
