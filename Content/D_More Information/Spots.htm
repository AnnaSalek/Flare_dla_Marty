        <h1>Ugly spots on a surface</h1>
        <p>
There are basically two causes of this issue:
</p>
        <p>1. <b>Butter bleed</b>. This means that the fat from the cookie has seeped into the icing (your cookie is literally "leaking" fat :D), leaving dark spots on the surface. This may happen in case of decorating freshly baked cookies (you bake and decorate on the same day).
</p>
        <p>2. Your cookie <b>isn't dried enough</b>. Always put your icing only on a hard and dry cookie; the best option is to put your cookie to a dehydrator or an oven for a half an hour before decorating.
</p>
        <p>3. <b>"Stale" icing</b>: the mixed, coloured icing loses its stability very fast and separates. Separation means that the liquids separate from the solids used in your icing. Generally speaking, though, the thinner the icing the faster it will separate. All you need to do when the icing separates is give it a good mix with a spoon or spatula and its ready to rock again! Obviously, its much more challenging to resurrect icing that has separated significantly in a piping bag, so I always recommend dumping it out into a bowl to mix. That said, if you're dealing with separation while decorating (and its been just a few hours), you can usually just massage the bag to reincorporate the icing. If you're decorating one day and don't finish the cookies, you CAN finish the cookies the next day. </p>
