        <h1 id="air-bubbles">Air bubbles</h1>
        <p>Air bubbles are caused when air is introduced to the icing.
There are a few ways to prevent this - please note, that if you have just a few air bubbles in your flooded cookie you can always puncture them with a scribe!</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/bubbles.jpg" title="You can see air bubbles on the left" alt="You can see air bubbles on the left" style="border-left-style: solid;border-left-width: 5px;border-right-style: solid;border-right-width: 5px;border-top-style: solid;border-top-width: 5px;border-bottom-style: solid;border-bottom-width: 5px;" />

        <ol>
            <li>Do not mix your icing for too long or at too high of a speed. Don't go above medium speed on your mixer.</li>
            <li>Before you bag your flood icing, allow the icing to sit in the bowl for a few minutes. The air bubbles will rise to the surface and then you can pop them gently with the surface of your spoon/spatula.
Once bagged, you can do two things:
Before closing the end of the bag with a clip, twist the end of the bag and hold tightly and then spin the icing around like a lasso. I know, sounds crazy! I’ve only had one mishap. But I find this to be the best way to remove air bubbles.
