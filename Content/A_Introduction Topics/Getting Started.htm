        <h1>Getting started with RI</h1>
        <p><a href="What is Royal Icing.htm" title="What is RI?" alt="What is RI?">Royal Icing</a> is a white decorating icing made from egg whites or meringue powder, powdered sugar, and water that hardens with air over time. This mixture can be made in many different <a href="../B_Feature Topics/Consistencies.htm" title="Consistencies info" alt="Consistencies info">consistencies</a> from very thick to very thin. For decorating cookies, royal icing is mixed, dyed, put into an piping bag and, finally, piped onto cookies using different consistencies. Once dry the icing is smooth and firm to the touch. Most often they can be easily stacked, stored, shipped, or packaged as favors and gifts.</p>
        <p>It’s important to note royal icing has a few “frenemies”:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Oil will break down royal icing during preparation, so be sure to make sure all of your tools are super clean from oil.</li>
            <li>Water will dissolve royal icing. While you will do this on purpose to thin your icing just a small drop of water after drying will be like acid to the icing eating away at it.</li>
            <li>Air is needed to dry the cookies once complete. Be careful to cover any icing while working with it or it will dry and crust over mid process.</li>
        </ul>
