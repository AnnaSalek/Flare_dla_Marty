        <h1>What is Royal Icing?</h1>
        <p>Royal Icing is, basicly, a mixture of powdered sugar and raw egg whites (or it's substitutes like meringue powder or pasteurized egg whites). Often stabilizers like cream or tartar, lemon juice or vinegar are also added as well as flavorings. Do not confuse it with frosting you can see on Polish doughnuts ("pączki") or buttercream on cupcakes avaliable in confectioneries or bakeries. They are similar, but not the same, and have different properties - RI dries into a hard candy-like shell while buttercream stays soft and creamy. On the picture below you can see cupcakes decorated by <a href="https://www.sugarbombe.com/" title="Cookie decorator Sugarbombe" alt="Cookie decorator Sugarbombe">Sugarbombe</a> with both of these mediums.</p>

        <p>Royal icing is a very finicky medium. It is sensitive to environment conditions (temperature/humidity) and can easily be ill-affected during preparation (i.e. over mixing, fat getting into the icing etc.). RI hardens when cooled, making it a great choice for decorating sugar cookies or gingerbreads. Its drying time is relatively long: if you don't use a food dehydrator, it takes about 8 hours to completely dry!</p>
