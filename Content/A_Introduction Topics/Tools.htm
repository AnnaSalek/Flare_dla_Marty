        <h1>What do you need to decorate your cookies (except for the Royal Icing)?</h1>
        <h2>
Cookies to decorate
</h2>
        <p>1. This can be your standard drop cookies such as chocolate chip cookies, butter cookies etc. For obvious reasons these will have a more uneven surface and tend to be more fragile.</p>
        <p>2. Rollout cookies (you roll them out with a rolling pin) are made into certain shapes and have a very clear definition in the shape. They have an almost flat surface and are much sturdier so they can be handled more easily. This can be butter cookies or gingerbreads (personally, I prefer gingerbreads over other types due to their stability and durablity).

        <h2>Tipless piping bags</h2>
        <p>
Food coloring
</p>
        <p>Scribe tool
</p>
        <p>Scribes are the pointy tool that we use to help icing settle and do other decorating techniques. You can certainly buy a fancy scribe, but toothpicks work fine as well! I used toothpicks for years before buying a scribe.
